Learn how to type, touch type.

Now this may seem obvious for some parts of the world but not as much for some nations where access to computers are not as ubiquitous than say the US.

I got hooked on computers, like a lot of us, thanks to my dad who would pass on to me his outdated personal computer. That was back in the 90s.
From then I just grabbed the keyboard, looked down and hunt and pecked with my indexes.

Along the way to college I added a few other fingers into the mix and thought I was good enough at typing. Oh boy.

<h3>Back to basics</h3>
It's not until much later, during my first job at an investment bank in New York that I realized how much I sucked at typing and decided to do something about it.

I had this alpha male Canadian colleague who's typing resembled the sound of a machine gun. I'm still impressed to this day.
I fired up an online typing test where he clocked in a 108 words per minute on his first try while I painfully reached 35 wpm. Shame.

I then went on my way to getting better, discovered the concept of 'home row' and that letters are assigned to fingers.

Your indexes should rest on the F an J keys respectively where those little bumps are there to tell you you are at the right place.
From there each finger should only venture up or down the keyboard except for the pinkies that have to do some extra side reach.
It's gonna be hard at first, you'll feel like you are stretching your pinky a bit, but eventually your muscle memory will adjust and you'll get more comfortable.

Then it's down to practice, practice and more practice. A couple of practice sites are linked below.
You'll get frustrated at first, think you'll never be as fast as with your old technique but don't give up.

When practicing always favor precision over speed. Speed will follow eventually. Remember: only correct practice makes perfect.

Now the trick to get better faster really is to stop looking down at the keys and to focus on what's appearing on the screen.
That's the 'touch' part. Rely on the F and J to tell you where your fingers are at the moment and to find your way back to the home row.

<h3>Benefits</h3>
I eventually now average 75 wpm @ 96% precision. Though not earth shattering it's still twice as fast as my starting point.

But the biggest advantage really lies in the fact that I no longer have to look down at the keys. This has made my workflow as a developer infinitely more efficient.
I can catch typos in my regexp as I create them on the screen or write complicated shell one liner easily.

I remember trying VIM back in college and the key bindings made no sense whatsoever to my dummy fingers. With my fingers at the right place those shortcuts now make perfect sense.
I understand the philosophy behind the home row and always keep it in mind when creating new bindings.

Touch typing has also sparked my shift to a fully keyboard controlled environment currently made of (i3 + tmux + VIM or Vim emulators + Vimium in the browser). With no constant reaching for the mouse I reduce the friction between me and the machine
and I can enter a flow state easily.
I'll write more about my setup in another post.
That's also why I know I wouldn't be a big fan of the new MacBook pro's touchbar: too far from the home row...

<h3>Next Level</h3>
When you feel confident enough in your typing, go ahead and get yourself a blank mechanical keyboard.

</p> That's right, a keyboard with no letters or numbers on the key caps.

This may sound extreme but that's one of the best move I've made to improve my touch typing.<br>
Simple: when there is nothing to look at on the keyboard, then you have no choice but to get your fingers on the home row and start typing.
It's a bit like being thrown in the water and forced to swim, except less life threatening. 

Get familiar with mechanical keyboards. Their key switches contain a spring as opposed to a bouncy rubber dome in cheap keyboards.
The CherryMX are the most commons and come in different feels and sounds.

I'm personally using a <a href="http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=topre_keyboards,rftenkeyless&pid=rf_se17t0">Topre Real Force 87U Tenkeyless ergonomically weighted</a> with blank blue keycaps.
Not only do they make you look like a badass at work, they also feel great when typing all day. They are well worth the investment.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
I'll be forever grateful to my Canadian colleague whose gentle bullying and mentoring has made me a much better all around technical guy.
I just wish somebody would have told me a lot earlier so I am sharing it out there for the younger generation.

In the end your job does not even matter. If it involves typing (especially under pressure) then do yourself a favor and start touch typing today.


<h3>Bonus and probably second advice I wish I had received</h3>

Remap Caps lock to Ctrl. And as soon as possible.

This is the smallest change you can make that's gonna yield the most benefits.
Ctrl is ubiquitous when it comes to shortcuts, in VIM, EMACS, in your shell in your IDE everywhere.
It's also very badly placed especially on laptop keyboards that squeezes in an extra function key.
As with all changes your brain is going to fight it at first but give it enough time and you'll never look back.
